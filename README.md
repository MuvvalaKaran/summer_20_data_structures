# Description 

A repository containing all the relevant work done for the course - [CSCI 2270 Data structures](https://experts.colorado.edu/display/coursename_103642) taught at CU Boulder.


# About the Course:

Studies data abstractions (e.g., stacks, queues, lists, trees, graphs) and their representation techniques (e.g., linking, arrays). Introduces concepts used in algorithm design and analysis including criteria for selecting data structures to fit their applications.

## Assignment Structure :

1. C++ fundamentals
2. Array doubling and dynamic memory
3. Linked List : Communication between towers
4. Linked List(cont.)
5. Stacks and Queues
6. Binary Search Trees
7. Binary Search Trees II
8. Graphs
9. Grpahs(cont.)
